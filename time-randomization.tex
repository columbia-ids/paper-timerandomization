\subsection{Threat Model}
The type of attack that time randomization seeks to thwart has the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The attack targets a concurrency bug.
	\item The attacker can gain knowledge about the relative timing between two
  or more threads relevant to the bug.
	\item The attacker leverages this knowledge to craft the attack.
\end{itemize}
Note that there are many ways to gain knowledge about relative thread timing, including results from fuzzing experiments.
In the case that the fuzzing is done on a binary, it may not even be obvious how many threads are involved.
Nevertheless, positive fuzzing results can be considered knowledge about relative thread timing which can then be used to craft an attack.

As an example, consider the following scenario:
A remote attacker is communicating with some server software, and has somehow become aware of a concurrency bug in that software.
He has devised a way to exploit the bug, which includes a method for inducing a buggy thread interleaving.
For concreteness, let's assume that the bug is exposed when a save operation
is attempted by one thread during the critical section of another save
operation in another thread (e.g., after some checking has been done, but before the results have been used, sometimes referred to as a time of check to time of use attack).
If the server immediately spawns threads to execute save operations in response to client requests, the attacker's work consists of identifying the proper delay between two save threads such that the critical sections intersect.
The critical sections in this context are sometimes referred to as a vulnerability window \cite{Yang2012}.

If the server software is available to the attacker, he can simply study it on a similar system (which he controls) to determine the appropriate delay required to expose the bug.
Armed with this knowledge, he stands a good chance of exploiting the bug on the target system by sending requests with the same delay.
\subsection{Automated Diversity}\label{automated-diversity}
Time randomization aims to make this type of attack much harder.
By making the relative timing between threads less predictable, the cost of carrying out the attack above is dramatically increased.

The three implementations for introducing automated diversity explored in this work consist of interposing external library calls \cite{Conrad2009} made by the software to be protected each with random numbers of inline assembly NOP instructions.
This was accomplished by first specifying a max delay (per interposition).
Then, for each of the external library functions chosen for interposition, a random integer between zero and the max delay was selected.
Finally, that number was used as the loop limit on a loop of assembly NOPs for that external library function.
The interpositions of the NOP loops were compiled into a dynamic library file, and that file was specified to be preloaded with the LD\_PRELOAD environment variable.
The three implementations vary only in the way that the library functions are chosen for interposition.
In all implementations, \texttt{ltrace} \cite{cespedesltrace} is run on the unmodified program to be protected while it is being subjected to an exploit attempt.
Using the log from that ltrace run,
\begin{enumerate}
	\item the first implementation chooses every external library function call for interposition,
	\item the second implementation chooses every external library function call immediately preceding a synchronization mechanism, and
	\item the third implementation chooses every external library function call immediately following a synchronization mechanism.
\end{enumerate}
Functions were only excluded in the rare cases that the function takes a
variable argument list, or interposing the function interferes with the
interposition method itself (e.g., \texttt{sigsetjmp}).
Both cases are unsuitable for the interposition method used in this work.
As all of the experiments were conducted on Linux, ``synchronization
mechanisms'' were generally identified as \texttt{pthread} function calls, except for the case of Libvirt which redefines its own synchronization mechanisms.
