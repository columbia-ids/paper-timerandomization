abstract = {Coverage analysis is a useful testing technology. However, some coverage models are more acceptable to the industry than others. In the field of testing multi-threaded applications, there is a need for a coverage model that can be used to evaluate tests for concurrent completeness and to find new testing requirements. We present a new coverage model: synchronization coverage. This model is simple to understand and the action items generated by each uncovered task are clear to testers and developers. We propose that synchronization coverage could, and should, become one of the more commonly used coverage models.},

abstract = {We present an architectural framework for systematically using automated diversity to provide high assurance detection and disruption of large classes of attacks. The framework executes a set of automatically diversified variants on the same inputs, and monitors their behavior to detect divergences. The benefit of this approach is that it requires an attacker to simultaneously compromise all system variants with the same input. By constructing variants with disjoint exploitation sets, we can make it impossible to carry out large classes of important attacks. In contrast to previous approaches that use automated diversity for security but rely on keeping secrets to provide probabilistic security properties, the security of our approach does not rely on keeping any secrets. In this paper, we introduce the N-variant systems framework, present a model for analyzing security properties of N-variant systems, define variations that can be used to detect attacks that involve referencing absolute memory addresses and executing injected code, and describe and present performance results from a prototype implementation.},

abstract = {son is that the contract between developers and runtimes grants exponentially many schedules to the runtimes. We present P ARROT , a simple, practical runtime with a new contract to developers. By default, it orders thread synchronizations in the well-defined round-robin order, vastly reducing schedules to provide determinism (more precisely, deterministic synchronizations) and stability (i.e., robustness against input or code perturbations, a more useful property than determinism). When default schedules are slow, it allows developers to write intu- itive performance hints in their code to switch or add schedules for speed. We believe this “meet in the mid- dle” contract eases writing correct, efficient programs. We further present an ecosystem formed by integrat- ing P ARROT with a model checker called DBUG . This ecosystem is more effective than either system alone: DBUG checks the schedules that matter to P ARROT , and P ARROT greatly increases the coverage of DBUG . Results on a diverse set of 108 programs, roughly 10 × more than any prior evaluation, show that P ARROT is easy to use (averaging 1.2 lines of hints per program); achieves low overhead (6.9\% for 55 real-world pro- grams and 12.7\% for all 108 programs), 10 × better than two prior systems; scales well to the maximum allowed cores on a 24-core server and to different scales/types of workloads; and increases DBUG ’s coverage by 10 6 – 10 19734 for 56 programs. P ARROT ’s source code, en- tire benchmark suite, and raw results are available at github.com/columbia/smt-mc},

abstract = {Deterministic multithreading (DMT) eliminates many pernicious software problems caused by nondeterminism. It works by constraining a program to repeat the same thread interleavings, or schedules, when given same input. Despite much recent research, it remains an open challenge to build both deterministic and efficient DMT systems for general programs on commodity hardware. To deterministically resolve a data race, a DMT system must enforce a deterministic schedule of shared memory accesses, or mem-schedule, which can incur prohibitive overhead. By using schedules consisting only of synchronization operations, or sync-schedule, this overhead can be avoided. However, a sync-schedule is deterministic only for race-free programs, but most programs have races. Our key insight is that races tend to occur only within minor portions of an execution, and a dominant majority of the execution is still race-free. Thus, we can resort to a mem-schedule only for the racy portions and enforce a sync-schedule otherwise, combining the efficiency of sync-schedules and the determinism of memschedules. We call these combined schedules hybrid schedules. Based on this insight, we have built PEREGRINE, an efficient deterministic multithreading system. When a program first runs on an input, PEREGRINE records an execution trace. It then relaxes this trace into a hybrid schedule and reuses the schedule on future compatible inputs efficiently and deterministically. PEREGRINE further improves efficiency with two new techniques: determinism-preserving slicing to generalize a schedule to more inputs while preserving determinism, and schedule-guided simplification to precisely analyze a program according to a specific schedule. Our evaluation on a diverse set of programs shows that PEREGRINE is deterministic and efficient, and can frequently reuse schedules for half of the evaluated programs.},

abstract = {A deterministic multithreading (DMT) system eliminates nondeterminism in thread scheduling, simplifying the development of multithreaded programs. However, existing DMT systems are unstable; they may force a program to (ad)venture into vastly different schedules even for slightly different inputs or execution environments, defeating many benefits of determinism. Moreover, few existing DMT systems work with server programs whose inputs arrive continuously and nondeterministically. TERN is a stable DMT system. The key novelty in TERN is the idea of schedule memoization that memoizes past working schedules and reuses them on future inputs, making program behaviors stable across different inputs. A second novelty in TERN is the idea of windowing that extends schedule memoization to server programs by splitting continuous request streams into windows of requests. Our TERN implementation runs on Linux. It operates as user-space schedulers, requiring no changes to the OS and only a few lines of changes to the application programs. We evaluated TERN on a diverse set of 14 programs (e.g., Apache and MySQL) with real and synthetic workloads. Our results show that TERN is easy to use, makes programs more deterministic and stable, and has reasonable overhead.},

Questions such as whether these attacks are feasible and what characteristics they have remain largely unknown. In this paper, we present a preliminary study of concurrency attacks and the security implications of real world concurrency errors. Our study yields several interesting findings. For instance, we observe that the exploitability of a concurrency error depends on the duration of the timing window within which the error may occur. We further observe that attackers can increase this window through carefully crafted inputs. We also find that four out of five commonly used sequential defenses become unsafe when applied to concurrent programs. Based on our findings, we propose new defense directions and fixes to existing defenses.},

abstract = {Diversity is an important source of robustness in biological
systems. Computers, by contrast, are notable for their lack of
diversity. Although homogeneous systems have many advantages, the
beneficial effects of diversity in computing systems have been
overlooked, specifically in the area of computer security. Several
methods of achieving software diversity are discussed based on
randomizations that respect the specified behavior of the program. Such
randomization could potentially increase the robustness of software
systems with minimal impact on convenience, usability, and efficiency.
Randomization of the amount of memory allocated on a stack frame is
shown to disrupt a simple buffer overflow attack},

@article{Franz2010,
abstract = {We contend that the time has come to revisit the idea of software diversity for defense purposes. Four fundamental paradigm shifts that have occurred in the past decade now make it viable to distribute a unique version of every program to every user. We outline a practical approach for providing compiler-generated software diversity on a massive scale. It is based on an "App Store" containing a diversification engine (a "multicompiler") that automatically generates a unique, but functionally identical version of every program each time that a downloader requests it. All the different versions of the same program behave in exactly the same way from the perspective of the end-user, but they implement their functionality in subtly different ways. As a result, any specific attack will succeed only on a small fraction of targets. An attacker would require a large number of different attacks and would have no way of knowing a priori which specific attack will succeed on which specific target. Hence, the cost to the attacker is raised dramatically. Equally importantly, our approach makes it much more difficult for an attacker to generate attack vectors by way of reverse engineering of security patches. An attacker requires two pieces of information to extract a vulnerability from a bug fix: the version of the program that is vulnerable and the specific patch that fixes the vulnerability. In an environment in which software is diversified and every instance of every program is unique, we can set things up so that the attacker never obtains a matching pair of vulnerable program and its corresponding bug fix that could be used to identify the vulnerability. We propose a mechanism for incremental updating of diversified software that has this property.},

@article{Giuffrida2012,
abstract = {n recent years, the deployment of many application-level countermeasures against memory errors and the increasing number of vulnerabilities discovered in the kernel has fostered a renewed interest in kernel-level exploitation. Unfortunately, no comprehensive and well-established mechanism exists to protect the operating system from arbitrary attacks, due to the relatively new development of the area and the challenges involved. In this paper, we propose the first design for fine-grained address space randomization (ASR) inside the operating system (OS), providing an efficient and comprehensive countermeasure against classic and emerging attacks, such as return-oriented programming. To motivate our design, we investigate the differences with application-level ASR and find that some of the well-established assumptions in existing solutions are no longer valid inside the OS; above all, perhaps, that information leakage becomes a major concern in the new context. We show that our ASR strategy outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in terms of both performance and security without affecting the software distribution model. Finally, we present the first comprehensive live rerandomization strategy, which we found to be particularly important inside the OS. Experimental results demonstrate that our techniques yield low run-time performance overhead (less than 5\% on average on both SPEC and syscall-intensive benchmarks) and limited run-time memory footprint increase (around 15\% during the execution of our benchmarks). We believe our techniques can greatly enhance the level of OS security without compromising the performance and reliability of the OS.},

abstract = {Code-reuse attacks are notoriously hard to defeat, and most current solutions to the problem focus on automated software diversity. This is a promising area of research, as diversity attacks the common denominator enabling code-reuse attacksthe software monoculture. Recent research in this area provides security, but at an unfortunate price: performance overhead. Leveraging previously collected profiling information, compilers can substantially improve subsequent code generation. Traditionally, profile-guided optimization focuses on hot program code, where a program spends most of its execution time. Optimizing rarely executed code does not significantly impact performance, so few optimizations focus on this code. We use profile-guided optimization to reduce the performance overhead of software diversity. The primary insight is that we are free to diversify cold code, but restrict our diversification efforts in hot code. Our work investigates the impact of profiling on an expensive diversification technique: NOP insertion. By differentiating between hot cold and cold code, we optimize NOP insertion overheads from a maximum of 25\% down to a negligible 1\%, while preserving the security properties of the original defense. Consequently, using our profile-guided diversification technique, even randomization techniques having a high performance overhead become practical.},

This monoculture makes flash worms possible. Our analysis of vulnerabilities and exploits identifies key assumptions required to develop successful attacks. We review the literature on synthetic diversity techniques, focusing primarily on those that can be implemented at the executable code level, since this is where we believe there is the most potential to reduce the common mode failure problem in COTS applications. Finally we propose a functional architecture for synthetic diversity at the executable code level that reduces the common mode failure problem in COTS applications by several orders of magnitude.

As a countermeasure, there has been a resurgent interest in moving target defenses in general and biologically inspired artificial software diversity in particular. While the concept of software diversity has interested researchers for over twenty years, technical obstacles have prevented its widespread adoption until now. But now, massive-scale software diversity has become practical due to the Internet (enabling distribution of individualized software) and cloud computing (computational power to perform diversification). In this article, we take stock of the current state of software diversity research, and what we see is quite encouraging. It turns out that the potential show-stopper issues are now mostly solved, but a few lesser concerns still separate us from widespread adoption. We describe these remaining issues and point to a realistic adoption path.},

abstract = {Address-space randomization is a technique used to fortify systems against buffer overflow attacks. The idea is to introduce artificial diversity by randomizing the memory location of certain system components. This mechanism is available for both Linux (via PaX ASLR) and OpenBSD. We study the effectiveness of address-space randomization and find that its utility on 32-bit architectures is limited by the number of bits available for address randomization. In particular, we demonstrate a derandomization attack that will convert any standard buffer-overflow exploit into an exploit that works against systems protected by address-space randomization. The resulting exploit is as effective as the original exploit, although it takes a little longer to compromise a target machine: on average 216 seconds to compromise Apache running on a Linux PaX ASLR system. The attack does not require running code on the stack. We also explore various ways of strengthening address-space randomization and point out weaknesses in each. Surprisingly, increasing the frequency of re-randomizations adds at most 1 bit of security. Furthermore, compile-time randomization appears to be more effective than runtime randomization. We conclude that, on 32-bit architectures, the only benefit of PaX-like address-space randomization is a small slowdown in worm propagation speed. The cost of randomization is extra complexity in system support.},

In this paper, we introduce the design and implementation of a framework based on a novel attack strategy, dubbed just-in-time code reuse, that undermines the benefits of fine-grained ASLR. Specifically, we derail the assumptions embodied in fine-grained ASLR by exploiting the ability to repeatedly abuse a memory disclosure to map an application’s memory layout on-the-fly, dynamically discover API functions and gadgets, and JIT-compile a target program using those gadgets—all within a script environment at the time an exploit is launched. We demonstrate the power of our framework by using it in conjunction with a real-world exploit against Internet Explorer, and also provide extensive evaluations that demonstrate the practicality of just-in-time code reuse attacks. Our findings suggest that fine-grained ASLR may not be as promising as first thought.},
