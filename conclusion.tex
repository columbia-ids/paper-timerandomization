We have presented time randomization, a subset of automated software diversity which randomizes the timing between and among threads, with the goal of thwarting concurrency attacks which benefit from predictability in that timing.
Our experiments show that at least one of the time randomization
transformations tested have a significant effect on the cost to exploit two
real-world concurrency bugs.
%reducing exploit success rate to less than 0.5\% in one, and significantly increasing the exploit cost in nearly 85\% of exploit attempts in the other.
We believe that transformations with lesser performance costs are worth studying as a defense against concurrency attacks.
