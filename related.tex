Automated software diversity as a defense strategy has been systematized by Larsen et al.~\cite{Larsen2014}.
That work proposes a taxonomy of cyberattacks and a taxonomy of defenses against those classes of attacks, and surveys many of the studied and unstudied diversification techniques.
To our knowledge, ours is the first work to investigate automated software diversity specifically as it pertains to concurrency attacks.

NOP injection, also known as ``garbage code insertion'', has been investigated many times.
Cohen~\cite{Cohen1993} and Forrest et al.~\cite{Forrest1997} proposed garbage code insertion as a method for diversifying operating system source code as a way to drive up the required complexity of attacks on systems.
Jackson et al. proposed NOP insertion as a diversification technique to be used by a compiler in automatically diversifying programs~\cite{Jackson2011}.

In perhaps the most pertinent related work, Jackson et al. later
